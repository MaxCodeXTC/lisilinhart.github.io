# Creating this portfolio
### Accessibility
It was important to me to create an portfolio that considered the most important aspects of accessibility.  The [Accessibility Checklist](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html) is a good resource to start with. Recently i used VoiceOver for the first time to navigate some website, which was quite frustrating in some cases. I would encourage every developer to try it out, because it gives you a great insight on how hard it can be to use screen readers, especially with websites that don’t think about accessibility at all. Another important aspect I took into consideration is making all content accessible via keyboard only.

### UX
The first versions of my portfolio involved a lot more animations and interactive things.  But although I do love animations, I decided to only use them where they actually make sense and don’t distract the user from what’s actually important. 

### Performance and Offline First
I decided to reduce the amount of images and external libraries I used to avoid bloat and also because I just like minimal things. If I used images, I only imported them in the size I actually needed to display them. I used [this boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) because it already has a lot of great things included, like Service Workers, Routing and Internationalization.  I could of course used something smaller like Preact, but decided to use this one, because I was already familiar with it. 

### Lessons learned
As a creative developer I constantly have new ideas about fun things to include in my portfolio and sometimes it’s hard to prioritise. I love [Codepen](https://codepen.io/lisilinhart/) for trying out ideas, but in the process of creating this portfolio, I also realised that it’s important to keep it simple and maybe concentrate on the most essential parts, because you can never include every idea that’s in your head.
